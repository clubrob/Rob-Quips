I spent the weekend watching the unrest across the US and reading important thoughts from diverse voices. We white folks have lots of work to do.

FWIW, I believe #BlackLivesMatter and if any of my followers has an issue with that (or wants to hedge/equivocate about it), it's probably best to unfollow. Love to the people in the streets doing the hard work.

Back to listening.
