This is a spot for me to host my short posts and to own my content apart from social platforms. These posts will get mirrored to my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/clubrob). Most of this is [Andy Bell's code](https://microblog.hankchizljaw.com/), but I tweaked colors, typography, and layout. Thanks, Andy!
